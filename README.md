probabilty of a galaxy hosting a AGN based on its galactic properties  
Im reading the paper "The triggering probability of radio-loud AGN: A comparison of high and low excitation radio galaxies in hosts of different colors" by Janssen et al. (2012)   
The paper was primarily trying to determine how the color and star formation properties of galaxies are connected to the type of AGN they host (HERGs vs. LERGs) and how this relates to the triggering mechanism for radio-loud AGNs.  

# Key Objectives and Findings of the Paper:

## AGN Type and Host Galaxy Properties:

The paper aimed to explore whether host galaxy properties (like galaxy color and morphology) can help explain the 'difference between HERGs and LERGs'.
HERGs are associated with star-forming galaxies, while LERGs are more common in elliptical, quiescent galaxies. The paper sought to investigate how these different galaxy types influence the likelihood of hosting an AGN and what type of AGN it is.

## AGN Triggering:

The paper also aimed to understand the 'triggering mechanism for these AGNs'. It sought to answer whether the properties of the host galaxy (such as stellar mass, gas content, and star formation rate) can explain the triggering probability of an AGN, and if these 'triggers are different for HERGs and LERGs'.
Specifically, the authors looked at whether galaxies with higher levels of star formation are more likely to host HERGs and 'how the environment or galaxy color' can influence the occurrence of these types of AGNs.

## Radio-Loud AGNs:

The paper focused on radio-loud AGNs, which are AGNs that emit strong radio emissions, often associated with relativistic jets. The authors compared the characteristics of radio-loud AGNs with galaxies in different regions of the color-magnitude diagram to identify trends and correlations.

## AGN Feedback Mechanisms:

While not the central focus, the paper also touched upon the 'impact of AGN feedback on its host galaxy'. Specifically, it looked at how AGN feedback might influence the evolution of the host galaxy, particularly whether HERGs and LERGs are related to 'different types of feedback'.


### Why This Is Important:  

Understanding the connection between the AGN type and the host galaxy properties helps to uunderstand the role of AGN feedback in galaxy evolution.  '
Identifying the factors that trigger AGN activity and understanding whether these triggers are different for HERGs and LERGs can provide insights into the evolutionary processes that govern galaxy and AGN co-evolution.  
AGN feedback, in particular, is essential for understanding how AGNs can regulate star formation in their host galaxies and affect the broader intergalactic medium.
