probabilty of a galaxy hosting a AGN based on its galactic properties
Im reading the paper "The triggering probability of radio-loud AGN: A comparison of high and low excitation radio galaxies in hosts of different colors" by Janssen et al. (2012) 

# Key Objectives and Findings of the Paper:

## AGN Type and Host Galaxy Properties:

The paper aimed to explore whether host galaxy properties (like galaxy color and morphology) can help explain the difference between HERGs and LERGs.
HERGs are associated with star-forming galaxies, while LERGs are more common in elliptical, quiescent galaxies. The paper sought to investigate how these different galaxy types influence the likelihood of hosting an AGN and what type of AGN it is.

## AGN Triggering:

The paper also aimed to understand the triggering mechanism for these AGNs. It sought to answer whether the properties of the host galaxy (such as stellar mass, gas content, and star formation rate) can explain the triggering probability of an AGN, and if these triggers are different for HERGs and LERGs.
Specifically, the authors looked at whether galaxies with higher levels of star formation are more likely to host HERGs and how the environment or galaxy color can influence the occurrence of these types of AGNs.

## Radio-Loud AGNs:

The paper focused on radio-loud AGNs, which are AGNs that emit strong radio emissions, often associated with relativistic jets. The authors compared the characteristics of radio-loud AGNs with galaxies in different regions of the color-magnitude diagram to identify trends and correlations.

## AGN Feedback Mechanisms:

While not the central focus, the paper also touched upon the impact of AGN feedback on its host galaxy. Specifically, it looked at how AGN feedback might influence the evolution of the host galaxy, particularly whether HERGs and LERGs are related to different types of feedback.
